## Applicaation structure

Let's start with the project structure:

```plaintext
exam_platform/
├── manage.py
├── exam_platform/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── wsgi.py
├── users/
├── exams/
├── questions/
├── progress/
├── exam_taking/
├── results/
├── dashboard/
├── payment/
├── admin/
```

Now, let's provide a sample code for each app. For the sake of brevity, we won't cover every aspect of the apps but rather provide an outline of the key components.

**1. Users App (`users`):**
- User registration, authentication, and profile management.

**2. Exams App (`exams`):**
- Models for exam categories, types, and subjects.
- Views for listing available exams.
- Templates for rendering exam details and allowing users to start exams.

**3. Questions App (`questions`):**
- Models for questions, including question types, options, and subjects.
- Views for listing questions by subject and difficulty level.

**4. Progress App (`progress`):**
- Models for user progress and scores.
- Views for displaying user scores and progress.

**5. Exam Taking App (`exam_taking`):**
- Views and forms for taking exams.
- Timer functionality for tracking exam duration.
- Logic for calculating and saving user responses and scores.

**6. Results App (`results`):**
- Views for displaying exam results and comparisons.
- Leaderboard functionality for comparing user scores.

**7. Dashboard App (`dashboard`):**
- User dashboard with links to available exams.
- Integration with the `exams` and `progress` apps.

**8. Payment App (`payment`):**
- Models for subscription plans and payments.
- Integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe).
- Views for handling payments and subscriptions.

**9. Admin App (`admin`):**
- Admin interface for managing users, exams, questions, and content moderation.


The next steps would involve defining models for each app, creating views, and templates, and setting up URLs to connect everything. The actual implementation can become quite detailed, so you may want to refer to Django's documentation for specific details on creating models, views, forms, and handling various aspects of web development.
