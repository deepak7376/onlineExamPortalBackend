Certainly! Here's an example of a properly normalized version of your database schema. I've made some modifications to improve normalization and reduce data redundancy:

**User Table:**

- User_id (Primary Key)
- Username
- Email (Unique)
- Password
- Registration_date
- Last_login
- Role_id (Foreign Key to Role table)
- Subscription_status_id (Foreign Key to SubscriptionStatus table)

**Role Table:**

- Role_id (Primary Key)
- Role_name (e.g., admin, teacher, student)

**SubscriptionStatus Table:**

- SubscriptionStatus_id (Primary Key)
- Status_name (e.g., active, expired, cancelled)

**Category Table:**

- Category_id (Primary Key)
- Category_name
- Description

**Question Table:**

- Question_id (Primary Key)
- Question_text
- Question_tag (optional)
- Question_type (multiple-choice, true-false, short-answer)
- Created_by (Foreign Key to User table)

**QuestionOption Table:**

- Option_id (Primary Key)
- Question_id (Foreign Key to Question table)
- Option_text
- Correct_answer (boolean to indicate if this is the correct option)

**Exam Table:**

- Exam_id (Primary Key)
- Title
- Description
- Duration
- Exam_type_id (Foreign Key to ExamType table)
- Pass_mark
- Created_by (Foreign Key to User table)
- Creation_date
- Code

**ExamType Table:**

- ExamType_id (Primary Key)
- Type_name (e.g., subjectwise, mock, premium)

**ExamAttempt Table:**

- Attempt_id (Primary Key)
- User_id (Foreign Key to User table)
- Exam_id (Foreign Key to Exam table)
- Start_time
- End_time
- Status_id (Foreign Key to ExamAttemptStatus table)
- Score
- Answers

**ExamAttemptStatus Table:**

- Status_id (Primary Key)
- Status_name (e.g., inprogress, completed)

This normalized schema eliminates redundancy and enforces referential integrity through foreign keys. It separates related data into different tables, making it more efficient and maintainable. You can now easily expand or modify your database without having to duplicate data and maintain consistency in roles, subscription statuses, exam types, and exam attempt statuses.


Certainly! Here are examples of the two relationship tables with more descriptive names:

**CategoryExamRelation Table:**

This table represents the relationship between categories and exams, indicating which exams belong to which categories.

| CategoryExamRelation_id | Category_id (Foreign Key) | Exam_id (Foreign Key) |
|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| 1                      | 101                       | 201                 |
| 2                      | 102                       | 202                 |
| 3                      | 101                       | 203                 |
| 4                      | 103                       | 204                 |

In this table, `CategoryExamRelation_id` is the primary key, and it establishes the relationship between categories (via `Category_id`) and exams (via `Exam_id`).

**ExamQuestionRelation Table:**

This table represents the relationship between exams and questions, indicating which questions are part of which exams.

| ExamQuestionRelation_id | Exam_id (Foreign Key) | Question_id (Foreign Key) |
|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1                      | 201                   | 301                      |
| 2                      | 201                   | 302                      |
| 3                      | 202                   | 303                      |
| 4                      | 203                   | 304                      |

In this table, `ExamQuestionRelation_id` is the primary key, and it establishes the relationship between exams (via `Exam_id`) and questions (via `Question_id`).

These descriptive table names and sample data make it clear how the relationship between categories, exams, and questions is maintained in the database.
